Selma is not (yet) available in the Play Store. You can download the [latest version](https://github.com/federvieh/selma/blob/master/build/Selma.apk?raw=true) of Selma directly from your device and install it. Have fun!

**Important notice:** In order to install Selma you need to allow installation of apps that were not downloaded from Play Store. Go to "Settings" - "Security" and make sure that "Unknown Sources" is checked.
{: .notice}

Until now Selma has only been tested with "Turkish with Ease" and Spanish. If you want to try to use the app with a different course, I would be happy to receive your feedback (positive or negative) and will try to make the app work for you.

### Prerequisites
Selma is for you if you already chose to learn a new language using the Assimil method and own the book and MP3 pack. It is known to work with "Kolay Türkçe" (Turkish with Ease) and the Spanish course, but it might also work with the language of your choice. Don't hesitate to contact the author, if it does or does not work with the language of your choice. Selma needs a device running on Android 2.2 ("Froyo") or above. Please note that Selma comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY (see the [license](https://github.com/federvieh/selma/blob/master/LICENSE) for details).

### Permissions
The app needs the following permissions for the following reasons:

* Read the contents of your USB storage: The MP3 files and translations are stored on the USB storage/SD card. No other content is read by Selma.

* Modify or delete the contents of your USB storage: The translations that you can enter will be written to the USB storage/SD card. No other content is deliberately written or deleted by Selma.

* Prevent phone from sleeping: When playing back the lessons, the phone will not go to sleep. Going to sleep would stop the playback immediately.
