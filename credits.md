### Assimil
Thanks to Assimil for their great language course "Turkish with Ease". In order to get more info on Assimil courses, please visit their [homepage](http://www.assimil.com/). In my opinion their courses are a great way of learning a new language. I, the author of Selma, am not affiliated with Assimil. I am simply a fan of their "Turkish with Ease" course.

I'd like to give a shout-out to Assimil Sprachverlag GmbH (the German subsidiary of Assimil). They helped me adding support for the "New Greek With Ease" course. Vielen, vielen Dank daf√ºr! Many thanks! If you speak German you should visit [their website](http://www.assimilwelt.com/).
