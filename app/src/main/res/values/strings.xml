    <string name="no_files_dialog_3_msg">You need to transfer the MP3s from the Assimil MP3 CD onto this device (or its SD card).\n\nIf you don\'t know how to do this, please ask a friend or seek help on the internet.\n\nPlease note that you need to own a Assimil MP3 CD in order to use this app!\n\nPlease also note, that Selma does not work with the Assimil Audio CD sets. Only MP3 CDs are supported.\n\nClick \"Quit\" if you now want to start copying the MP3 files. Click \"Continue\" if you have already copied the files to this device.</string>
    <string name="no_files_dialog_4_msg">Good, so you already copied the MP3 files to this device, but unfortunately they were not found by Selma.\n\nThere can be several reasons for this.\n\nMaybe Selma was not shut down properly before the files were copied to this device. Please click on \"Re-try\" to let Selma scan again for files. Afterwards you will see a list with all the lessons available on this device or you will again see the dialogs you just clicked through. If that is the case, just click \"Continue\" until you are back here.\n\nIf you already tried this, please click \"Continue\".</string>
    <string name="retry">Re-try</string>
    <string name="no_files_dialog_5_msg">Another reason why the files don\'t show up in this app, is that your device did not yet recognize the new files. Normally, the files are recognized after they have been transferred and the device has been disconnected from the computer. However, it may be that this device did not yet scan for new files. You can check this in the \"Google Play Music\" app. To start this app, please click on \"Open\" and see if the Assimil course is shown there. After that please start Selma again. You will again see the dialogs you just clicked through. Please just click \"Continue\" until you are back here.\n\n If you already checked, and the course is also not shown in \"Google Play Music\", it is recommended to turn this device off and on again (sorry for the inconvenience). Please click on \"Quit\" and then turn off this device. After re-starting check again in \"Google Play Music\".\n\nClick on \"Continue\" if you have checked in \"Google Play Music\".</string>
    <string name="no_files_dialog_6_msg">Okay, so you have copied the files onto this device and you have rebooted it. Still the files don\'t show up here.\n\nHave the files been shown in \"Google Play Music\"?</string>
    <string name="yes">Yes</string>
    <string name="no">No</string>
    <string name="no_files_dialog_7a_msg">The course is shown in \"Google Play Music\" but not here, so probably Selma does not yet support your Assimil course. Please type in the ISBN number that is given on the box of the MP3 CD in the following field and click on \"Send email&#8230;\". I will try to figure out (together with your help) if it is possible to make Selma work for you.\n\nISBN:</string>
    <string name="no_files_dialog_7b_msg">Selma relies on the same mechanisms as \"Google Play Music\". If the files do not show up in there, it is also impossible for Selma to find them. If you don\'t know how to make the files show in \"Google Play Music\" there is not much support we can give you at this time. We are very sorry for this! Please consult a friend or internet resources on how to make your MP3s show up in \"Google Play Music\".</string>
