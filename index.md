Selma
=====
Selma is an Android app that helps you in learning a new language using the Assimil language training courses' MP3 CDs.

**Important notice:** The MP3 files that are needed for using this app are not contained. You need to buy the course (book and MP3 CD) separately and transfer the MP3s from the CD onto your android device. The app cannot be used without.

### How to use Selma

If you have not already done this, start by copying your Assimil MP3 pack to your Android device.

In Selma it is possible to mark lessons as favourites using the star icon. This allows you to focus on the lessons you are currently trying to memorise. I normally have three or four "starred" lessons which I listen to over and over.

You can tell Selma, if you want to listen only to the lesson texts or also the exercise section. When I'm memorising my "starred" lessons, most of the times I don't listen to the exercises, because it's easier to memorise stories than sentences that have no obvious connection. But when I start learning a new lesson, I also listen to the exercises.

When learning a lesson, you can choose to listen to individual sentences or the whole lesson over and over. You can also manually enter a translation and a literal translation of the lesson texts, so that you can see the translation directly in the app. Unfortunately, Assimil does not provide the translations along with the MP3 pack. Which means you have to enter them yourself. But in my opinion this procedure also helps with learning.
