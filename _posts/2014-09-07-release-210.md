I'm happy to announce the release of Selma 2.1.0.

This version now also supports "New Greek With Ease" and possibly a few more. If you have tried to use Selma in the past and it didn't work with your course, now might be a good time to try again. I'm always happy receive information for which course you are using Selma and add it to the list of known working courses. Currently, known to work are the following courses:

* Turkisch With Ease
* Spanish
* New Greek With Ease

I'd like to give a shout-out to Assimil Sprachverlag GmbH (the German subsidiary of Assimil). They helped me adding support for the "New Greek With Ease" course. Vielen, vielen Dank daf√ºr! Many thanks! If you speak German you should visit [their website](http://www.assimilwelt.com/).

There have been a few changes in the internal structure of Selma, which result in the following new feature:

* Improved start-up time (from more than half a minute to a fraction of a second). The first start is still slow and might even take a few minutes depending on the number of Assimil lessons you have on your device.
* It's now possible to fix mistakes/typos in the original lesson texts that are read from the MP3 files.

Thanks for using Selma and have fun learning!
