Finally Selma 2.2.0 has been released!

This version now also supports showing the MP3 files from the Assimil PC Software for Russian and possibly a few more. The current list of courses that is known to work is: 

* Turkisch With Ease
* Spanish
* New Greek With Ease
* PC software for Russian

If you are using Selma with any other course, I'd be glad to hear about it. Either send me a mail or leave a comment below.

I'd also like you to share your opinion how you think Selma could be improved in the future, either by mail, the comments section below or by raising a github issue.

Please note that the MP3 files from the PC software unfortunately do not contain the lesson text in written form. You can still enter the text yourself if you want to, but even without that it's nice just to play back the lessons in an orderly way on your mobile device.

Thanks for using Selma and have fun learning!
